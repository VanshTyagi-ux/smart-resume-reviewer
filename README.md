üéØ The Problem 

The modern job search is filled with challenges that often lead to a frustrating experience and missed opportunities. We identified three core issues for job seekers:



The Black Hole: A vast majority of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) before a human ever sees them.


The Tailoring Trap: Crafting a unique, tailored resume for every single job application is exhausting and time-consuming.


The Feedback Barrier: Access to expert, personalized resume feedback is often expensive or unavailable, leaving candidates guessing.

üöÄ Our Solution 

The Smart Resume Reviewer is an intelligent platform that provides instant, data-driven feedback by analyzing a user's resume against a specific job role. It helps users create a document that stands out to both recruiters and algorithms, transforming their resumes from good to interview-winning.



‚ú® Key Features 

Our application is packed with features to streamline the resume optimization process:


Flexible Input: Users can upload a PDF or TXT file, or simply paste text for both their resume and the job description.


Deep AI Analysis: A two-step AI process provides a comprehensive review, including an overall score, key strengths, areas for improvement, and missing keywords.


ATS Compliance Tips: The app provides crucial, expert-level advice on how to optimize the resume to successfully pass through automated screening systems.


Professional PDF Generation: The application generates a beautifully formatted, enhanced resume in a professional template, ready to be downloaded and submitted.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works: System Architecture 

The application follows a stable and reliable two-step AI process:


User Input: The user provides their resume and a target job role on the Streamlit frontend.


AI Analysis (Call 1): The backend sends the data to the Gemini API to get a detailed analysis (score, strengths, ATS tips, etc.) as a JSON object.


AI Rewrite (Call 2): The original resume and the AI's analysis are sent back to the Gemini API, which rewrites the resume into a structured JSON format.


PDF Templating: The structured resume data is passed to a Jinja2 HTML template.


PDF Generation: The xhtml2pdf library converts the rendered HTML into a high-quality, downloadable PDF.



Display Results: The complete analysis and PDF download link are presented to the user.
